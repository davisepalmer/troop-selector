(4) Run the  *.exe* file. <br>
(5) Begin your attack. <br>
(6) Before placing your first troop do the following actions: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Hit the "Backspace" button on your keyboard (This tells the program to listen for your clicks so it can make sure it is switching with the right spacing. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Now click middle of the first troop <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Click the middle of the second troop <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Finally click the middle of the first troop again. <br>
(7) Now everything should be working and you can use your arrow keys to switch between troops.
(8) After done attacking hit the ESC key and it will exit the program. Run it again for your next attack <br> <br>
**Note:** Going across your heroes will activate the abilities if they are already placed down. Have fun ðŸ˜€!
